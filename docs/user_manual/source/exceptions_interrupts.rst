Exceptions and Interrupts
=========================

|corev| implements trap handling for interrupts and exceptions according to [RISC-V-PRIV]_.
The ``irq_i[31:16]`` interrupts are a custom extension.

When entering an interrupt/exception handler, the core sets the ``mepc`` CSR to the current program counter and saves ``mstatus``.MIE to ``mstatus``.MPIE.
All exceptions cause the core to jump to the base address of the vector table in the ``mtvec`` CSR.
Interrupts are handled in either direct mode or vectored mode depending on the value of ``mtvec``.MODE. In direct mode the core
jumps to the base address of the vector table in the ``mtvec`` CSR. In vectored mode the core jumps to the base address
plus four times the interrupt ID. Upon executing an MRET instruction, the core jumps to the program counter previously saved in the
``mepc`` CSR and restores ``mstatus``.MPIE to ``mstatus``.MIE.

The base address of the vector table must be aligned to 256 bytes (i.e., its least significant byte must be 0x00) and can be programmed
by writing to the ``mtvec`` CSR. For more information, see the :ref:`cs-registers` documentation.

The core starts fetching at the address defined by ``boot_addr_i``. It is assumed that the boot address is supplied via a register
to avoid long paths to the instruction fetch unit.

Interrupt Interface - ``SMCLIC`` == 0
-------------------------------------

If the ``SMCLIC`` parameter is set to 0, then |corev| is configured to support the basic (a.k.a. CLINT) interrupt architecture. In this configuration only the
basic interrupt handling modes (non-vectored basic mode and vectored basic mode) can be used.

:numref:`Interrupt interface signals` describes the interrupt interface.

  |                         |           | specification. irq_i[11], irq_i[7], and irq_i[3] |

  |                         |           | respectively. The irq_i[31:16] interrupts        |
  |                         |           | are a |corev| specific extension to the RISC-V   |
  |                         |           | Basic (a.k.a. CLINT) interrupt scheme.           |
  +-------------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------+

Interrupts - ``SMCLIC`` == 0
----------------------------

The ``irq_i[31:0]`` interrupts are controlled via the ``mstatus``, ``mie`` and ``mip`` CSRs. |corev| uses the upper 16 bits of ``mie`` and ``mip`` for custom interrupts (``irq_i[31:16]``),
which reflects an intended custom extension in the RISC-V basic (a.k.a. CLINT) interrupt architecture.
After reset, all interrupts, except for NMIs, are disabled.
To enable any of the ``irq_i[31:0]`` interrupts, both the global interrupt enable (``MIE``) bit in the ``mstatus`` CSR and the corresponding individual interrupt enable bit in the ``mie`` CSR need to be set. For more information, see the :ref:`cs-registers` documentation.


If multiple interrupts are pending, they are handled in the fixed priority order defined by [RISC-V-PRIV]_.
The highest priority is given to the interrupt with the highest ID, except for the Machine Timer Interrupt, which has the lowest priority. So from high to low priority the interrupts are
ordered as follows: 

* ``store parity/checksum fault NMI (1027)``
* ``load parity/checksum fault NMI (1026)``
* ``store bus fault NMI (1025)``
* ``load bus fault NMI (1024)``
* ``irq_i[31]``
* ``irq_i[30]``
* ...
* ``irq_i[16]``
* ``irq_i[11]``
* ``irq_i[3]``
* ``irq_i[7]``

The ``irq_i[31:0]`` interrupt lines are level-sensitive. The NMIs are triggered by load/store bus fault events and load/store parity/checksum fault events.
To clear the ``irq_i[31:0]`` interrupts at the external source, |corev| relies on a software-based mechanism in which the interrupt handler signals completion of the handling routine to the interrupt source, e.g., through a memory-mapped register, which then deasserts the corresponding interrupt line.

In Debug Mode, all interrupts are ignored independent of ``mstatus.MIE`` and the content of the ``mie`` CSR.

|corev| can trigger the following interrupts as reported in ``mcause``:

 +----------------+----------------+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::

   Load bus fault, store bus fault,  load parity/checksum fault and store parity/checksum fault are handled as imprecise non-maskable interrupts
   (as opposed to precise exceptions).

Interrupt Interface - ``SMCLIC`` == 1
-------------------------------------

If the ``SMCLIC`` parameter is set to 1, then |corev| is configured to support the CLIC interrupt architecture. In this configuration only the
CLIC interrupt handling mode can be used and the ``irq_i[31:0]`` pins are ignored and should be tied to 0.

Interrupts - ``SMCLIC`` == 1
----------------------------

Although the [RISC-V-SMCLIC]_ specification supports up to 4096 interrupts, |corev| itself supports at most 1024 interrupts. The
maximum number of supported CLIC interrupts is equal to ``2^SMCLIC_ID_WIDTH``, which can range from 64 to 1024. The ``SMCLIC_ID_WIDTH`` parameter
also dictates the minimum alignment requirement for the trap vector table to ``2^(2+SMCLIC_ID_WIDTH)`` byte boundaries, see :ref:`csr-mtvt`.

Non Maskable Interrupts
-----------------------

NMIs update ``mepc``, ``mcause`` and ``mstatus`` similar to regular interrupts. However, as the faults that result in NMIs are imprecise, the contents of ``mepc`` is not guaranteed to point to the instruction after the faulted load or store.

.. note::

   Specifically ``mstatus.mie`` will get cleared to 0 when an (unrecoverable) NMI is taken. [RISC-V-PRIV]_ does not specify the behavior of 
   ``mstatus`` in response to NMIs, see https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/issues/756. If this behavior is
   specified at a future date, then we will reconsider our implementation.

An NMI will occur when a load or store instruction experiences a bus fault. The fault resulting in an NMI is handled in an imprecise manner, meaning that the instruction that causes the fault is allowed to retire and the associated NMI is taken afterwards.
NMIs are never masked by the ``MIE`` bit. NMIs are masked however while in debug mode or while single stepping with ``STEPIE`` = 0 in the ``dcsr`` CSR.
This means that many instructions may retire before the NMI is visible to the core if debugging is taking place. Once the NMI is visible to the core, at most two instructions may retire before the NMI is taken.
This is guaranteed, as the core will stop issuing new instructions when any interrupt, including NMI, is pending. This will eventually cause an interruptible time slot.

If an NMI becomes pending while in debug mode as described above, the NMI will be taken in the first available cycle after debug mode has been exited.

In case of bufferable stores, the NMI is allowed to become visible an arbitrary time after the instruction retirement. As for the case with debugging, this can cause several instructions to retire
before the NMI becomes visible to the core.


When a data bus fault occurs, the first detected fault will be latched and used for ``mcause`` when the NMI is taken. Any new data bus faults occuring while an NMI is pending will be discarded.
When the NMI handler is entered, new data bus faults may be latched.

While an NMI is pending, ``DCSR.nmip`` will be 1. Note that this CSR is only accessible from debug mode, and is thus not visible for machine mode code.


CLIC
----

|corev| supports CLIC with 2^``SMCLIC_ID_WIDTH`` interrupts, see the CLIC_ spec.

|corev| can trigger the following exceptions as reported in ``mcause``:

 |                |                |                                       | to region without atomic support.                                         |
 |                |                |                                       | Store attempt with address failing PMP check.                             |

 |              0 |              8 | Environment call from U-Mode (ECALL)  |                                                                           |
 +----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |              0 |             11 | Environment call from M-Mode (ECALL)  |                                                                           |
 +----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |              0 |             48 | Instruction bus fault                 | ``instr_err_i`` = 1 and ``instr_rvalid_i`` = 1 for instruction fetch      |

 |              0 |             49 | Instruction parity/checksum fault     | ``instr_gntpar_i``, ``instr_rvalidpar``, ``instr_rchk_i`` related errors  |
 +----------------+----------------+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If an instruction raises multiple exceptions, the priority, from high to low, is as follows: 

* ``instruction access fault (1)``
* ``instruction parity/checksum fault (49)``
* ``instruction bus fault (48)``
* ``illegal instruction (2)``
* ``environment call from U-Mode (8)``
* ``environment call from M-Mode (11)``
* ``environment break (3)``
* ``store/AMO access fault (7)``
* ``load access fault (5)``

Exceptions in general cannot be disabled and are always active. 
All exceptions are precise.
Whether the PMP and PMA will actually cause exceptions depends on their configuration.
|corev|  raises an illegal instruction exception for any instruction in the RISC-V privileged and unprivileged specifications that is explicitly defined as being
illegal according to the ISA implemented by the core, as well as for any instruction that is left undefined in these specifications unless the instruction encoding
is configured as a custom |corev| instruction for specific parameter settings as defined in (see :ref:`custom-isa-extensions`).
An instruction bus error leads to a precise instruction interface bus fault if an attempt is made to execute the instruction that has an associated bus error.
Similarly an instruction fetch with a failing PMA or PMP check only leads to an instruction access exception if an actual execution attempt is made for it.

Nested Interrupt/Exception Handling
-----------------------------------

|corev| does support nested interrupt/exception handling in software.
The hardware automatically disables interrupts upon entering an interrupt/exception handler.
Otherwise, interrupts/exceptions during the critical part of the handler, i.e. before software has saved the ``mepc`` and ``mstatus`` CSRs, would cause those CSRs to be overwritten.
If desired, software can explicitly enable interrupts by setting ``mstatus``.MIE to 1 from within the handler.
However, software should only do this after saving ``mepc`` and ``mstatus``.
There is no limit on the maximum number of nested interrupts.
Note that, after enabling interrupts by setting ``mstatus``.MIE to 1, the current handler will be interrupted also by lower priority interrupts.
To allow higher priority interrupts only, the handler must configure ``mie`` accordingly.

The following pseudo-code snippet visualizes how to perform nested interrupt handling in software.

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   isr_handle_nested_interrupts(id) {
     // Save mpec and mstatus to stack
     mepc_bak = mepc;
     mstatus_bak = mstatus;

     // Save mie to stack (optional)
     mie_bak = mie;

     // Keep lower-priority interrupts disabled (optional)
     mie = mie & ~((1 << (id + 1)) - 1);

     // Re-enable interrupts
     mstatus.MIE = 1;

     // Handle interrupt
     // This code block can be interrupted by other interrupts.
     // ...

     // Restore mstatus (this disables interrupts) and mepc
     mstatus = mstatus_bak;
     mepc = mepc_bak;

     // Restore mie (optional)
     mie = mie_bak;
   }

Nesting of interrupts/exceptions in hardware is not supported.
