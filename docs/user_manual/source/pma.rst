Physical Memory Attribution (PMA)
=================================
The |corev| includes a Physical Memory Attribution (PMA) unit that allows compile time attribution of the physical memory map.
The PMA is configured through the top level parameters ``PMA_NUM_REGIONS`` and ``PMA_CFG[]``.
The number of PMA regions is configured through the ``PMA_NUM_REGIONS`` parameter. Valid values are 0-16.
The configuration array, ``PMA_CFG[]``, must consist of ``PMA_NUM_REGIONS`` entries of the type ``pma_region_t``, defined in ``cv32e40s_pkg.sv``:

.. code-block:: verilog

  typedef struct packed {
    logic [31:0] word_addr_low;
    logic [31:0] word_addr_high;
    logic        main;
    logic        bufferable;
    logic        cacheable;
  } pma_region_t;

In case of address overlap between PMA regions, the region with the lowest index in ``PMA_CFG[]`` will have priority.
The PMA can be deconfigured by setting ``PMA_NUM_REGIONS=0``. When doing this, ``PMA_CFG[]`` should be left unconnected.

Address range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The address boundaries of a PMA region are set in ``word_addr_low/word_addr_high``. These contain bits 33:2 of 34-bit, word aligned addresses. To get an address match, the transfer address ``addr`` must be in the range ``{word_addr_low, 2'b00} <= addr[33:0] < {word_addr_high, 2'b00}``. Note that ``addr[33:32] = 2'b00`` as the |corev| does not support Sv32.

Main memory vs I/O
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Memory ranges can be defined as either main (``main=1``) or I/O (``main=0``). 
Code execution is allowed from main memory and main memory is considered to be idempotent. Non-aligned transactions are supported in main memory.
Code execution is not allowed from I/O regions and an instruction access fault (exception code 1) is raised when attempting to execute from such regions. 
I/O regions are considered to be non-idempotent and therefore the PMA will prevent speculative accesses to such regions.
Non-aligned transactions are not supported in I/O regions.  An attempt to perform a non-naturally aligned load access to an I/O region causes a precise
load access fault (exception code 5). An attempt to perform a non-naturally aligned store access to an I/O region causes a precise store access fault (exception code 7).

Bufferable and Cacheable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Accesses to regions marked as bufferable (``bufferable=1``) will result in the OBI ``mem_type[0]`` bit being set, except if the access was an instruction fetch, a load, or part of an atomic memory operation. Bufferable stores will utilize the write buffer, see :ref:`Write buffer <write_buffer>`.

Accesses to regions marked as cacheable (``cacheable=1``) will result in the OBI ``mem_type[1]`` bit being set.

Default attribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the PMA is deconfigured (``PMA_NUM_REGIONS=0``), the entire memory range will be treated as main memory (``main=1``), non-bufferable (``bufferable=0``) and non-cacheable (``cacheable=0``).

If the PMA is configured (``PMA_NUM_REGIONS > 0``), memory regions not covered by any PMA regions are treated as I/O memory (``main=0``), non-bufferable (``bufferable=0``) and non-cacheable (``cacheable=0``).

Every instruction fetch, load and store will be subject to PMA checks and failed checks will result in an exception. PMA checks cannot be disabled.
See :ref:`exceptions-interrupts` for details.
